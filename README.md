# Hackathon Backend

This is the backend for the hackathon project

## Teck Stack
1. Payload CMS
2. Mongo DB

## Introduction
I used a Headless CMS to create a backend for the hackathon project because no one got time to build a backend with all its features from scratch. A Headless CMS saves everyone's time and allows for easy updates.
